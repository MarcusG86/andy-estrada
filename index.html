      <h4><span>Mission Statement</span></h4>
      <p>
        After much discussion, thought and prayer I have decided to run for a seat on the City Council in Casa Grande. With support from my family, friends and fellow citizens I want to make a difference in our community. I want to thank everyone who has encouraged me and helped to make this decision so easy. While a single councilman may not be able to make every change that we would like, I will do my BEST to make sure that your voices are heard.
      </p>

      <p>As a lifelong resident of Pinal county, I have seen the good and the bad times that have affected us all. From a young age, I have been active in our community and participated in many of the activities that our city offers. Upon completion of high school I enlisted in the United State Marine Corp. During this time I had the honor of defending our freedom in Operation Desert Storm. After honorably serving my country and being a combat veteran, I returned home to Casa Grande and started a family. Currently I am employed as a Realtor and Sales Manager for a local real estate company. I am also serving as a Planning and Zoning Commissioner. In addition to my career in real estate, have managed local car dealerships, as well as other retail businesses.
      </p>
      <p>As a resident and Planning and Zoning Commissioner, I understand the problems that our community is facing. The City of Casa Grande needs to address issues such as policies that promote sustainable growth, affordable housing and retain businesses that are the lifeblood of our community. The City also needs to upgrade and improve our existing road systems and fight to keep our tax dollars local. I also see our youth with limited opportunities to socialize and have fun in a safe environment.
      </p>
      <p>Growth in our area is something that affects us all. While we enjoy our small town lifestyle, we all want better opportunities for ourselves and for our children. The City of Casa Grande needs to promote sustainable growth, both residential and commercial, in order for our town to thrive. Casa Grande currently has some of the highest impact/development fees in our area. As citizens we are witnessing the communities surrounding our own flourish, while Casa Grande continues to fall behind. Elaborate projects have been promoted by our City, while the smaller projects that provide us jobs and affordable housing have been stifled. Currently the City is working to restructure how development fees are paid. I do not believe that they are doing enough. In order to be competitive with surrounding communities we need to have fees and rules that allow home builders and businesses the chance to compete on an equal basis and thrive. While many feel that businesses and developers should be made to pay for any impact they make on our town. I can drive through Casa Grande and see the results of these policies in the numerous empty storefronts and abandoned subdivisions.
      </p>
      <p>Are you aware that the State of Arizona is not giving Casa Grande it’s fair share of tax money to improve our roads? Many of our roads are badly in need of repair or upgrades. Main roads into our community such as McCartney Rd. are undersized and can not support the traffic, especially during the morning and evening rush and during the winter months. I want to join our Mayor in the fight to help keep our tax dollars in our town and used for our roads as it was intended.
      </p>
      <p>It is our responsibility as citizens to guide Casa Grande’s growth in the future. It will be my mission to guide this growth in positive manner. My goal as a citizen and future councilman of Casa Grande is for our City to grow and prosper in a way that we retain the charm of the town we love as we move into the future. These goals can be met responsibly by “Cultivating the Growth for Casa Grande”
