        <h2>Cultivated Growth for Casa Grande</h2>
        <p>
          These words are more than a campaign slogan.  They stand for affordable housing and better jobs for our community.  As a lifelong resident of this city I am concerned by the amount of vacant businesses and empty subdivisions found throughout town.  I support efforts by our current mayor to make Casa Grande easier to do business with.  Attracting new businesses large and small benefit our community as a whole.  As home prices are on the rise again, I want to work with developers to finish the many vacant subdivisions that already exist in our city.  Growth is coming to our area, it is my goal to promote responsible growth and encourage realistic business development in our City.

        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>
          Our road system is the gateway to our community.  From driving to work or running to the store for most of us, our roads are critical to our daily lives.  Apart from pure functionality, our roads and medians are a representation of who we are as a city.  I support the current efforts to widen I-10 between Casa Grande and Phoenix.  This project is critical for our future.  In addition to the interstate, we need to take a close look at the roads in our community.  Some of our roadways are in desperate need of updating and widening.  From the older parts of town where roads are in need of repairs, to some of our major arteries that need widening and signal projects finished. I want to work to make our roadways more efficient and work to complete unfinished sections of critical streets.

        <h2>New Ideas for a new time</h2>
        <p>
          Casa Grande has been on the same general path for generations.  Our community spoke out when they elected our current Mayor that change was needed.  I plan to support our mayor as we continue into the future.  The policies of the past will not work for the modern city that we are becoming. I want our community to be a place where our children are well educated and have limitless opportunity to thrive.  I want our city government to be responsive to the publicâ€™s needs and wants.  My ultimate goal is to serve this city on your City Council and leave it better off for future generations.
